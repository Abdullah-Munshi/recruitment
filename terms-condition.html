              Acceptable use<br />
              - You may use our site only for lawful purposes. You may not use
              our site:<br />
              - In any way that breaches any applicable local, national or
              international law or regulation.<br />
              - In any way that is unlawful or fraudulent, or has any unlawful
              or fraudulent purpose or effect.<br />
              - For the purpose of harming or attempting to harm minors in any
              way.<br />
              - To send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any
              material which does not comply with our content standards. - To
              transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or
              unauthorised advertising or promotional material or any other form
              of similar solicitation (spam).<br />
              - To knowingly transmit any data, send or upload any material that
              contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke
              loggers, spyware, adware or any other harmful programs or similar
              computer code designed to adversely affect the operation of any
              computer software or hardware.<br />
              You also agree:<br />
              - Not to reproduce, duplicate, copy or re-sell any part of our
              site in contravention of these terms of use.<br />
              - Not to access without authority, interfere with, damage or
              disrupt any part of our site, any equipment or network on which
              our site is stored, any software used in the provision of our site
              or any equipment or network or software owned or used by any third
              party.<br />
              Interactive services - We may from time to time provide
              interactive services on our site, including, without limitation,
              chat rooms, bulletin boards and blogs ("interactive
              services").Where we do provide any interactive service, we will
              provide clear information to you about the kind of service
              offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used
              (including whether it is human or technical). Where we do moderate
              an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means
              of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty
              arise.<br />
              We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in
              particular, for children) from third parties when they use any
              interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in
              each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the
              relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the
              light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to
              oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on
              our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or
              damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user
              in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is
              moderated or not.<br />
              The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject
              to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who
              permit their children to use an interactive service that it is
              important that they communicate with their children about their
              safety online, as moderation is not fool proof. Minors who are
