            This document explains how we use your personal data.<br />
            We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our customers and
            other website visitors. This policy explains how we handle your
            personal data.<br />
            1. How we use your personal data This section provides you with
            details about:<br />
            · what personal data we may process;<br />
            · in the case of personal data that we did not obtain directly
            from you, where we obtained that data from, and what types of data
            we have collected;<br />
            · the purposes for which we may process your personal data; and<br />
            · the legal grounds on which we process your data.<br />
            Account data. We may process the personal data that you have
            provided to us when you register so that we can set up your
            account with us ("account data"). The account data may include
            your name and email address. The account data may be processed for
            the purposes of operating our website, providing our services,
            ensuring the security of our website and services, maintaining
            back-ups of our databases and communicating with you. The legal
            basis for this processing is our legitimate interests.<br />
            We may consider you for opportunities that you did not
            specifically apply for but which we think might be a good fit for
            your skillset. We may also share your account data with our
            partner agencies, and process your account data to facilitate
            finding you a job. The legal basis for this processing is our
            legitimate interests in finding an appropriate candidate for
            particular roles and vacancies.<br />
            We will then ask you if you would like to be put forward for such
            opportunities. If you consent to us doing so, we will pass your
            account data to those relevant employers. Where you have given us
            your information for the purposes detailed above, we will enter
            the account data into our central recruitment database (“talent

            our website and services. The legal basis for this processing is
            our legitimate interests.<br />

            that you have applied for, generally processing any job
            applications, facilitating the recruitment process and furthering
            our relationship with you. The legal basis for this processing is
            our legitimate interests in finding an appropriate person for a
            particular role.<br />

            your personal information for marketing purposes.<br />The rights
            you have under data protection law are:<br />
            · the right to access;<br />

            · the right to erasure;<br />
            · the right to restrict processing;<br />

            · the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and<br />
            · the right to withdraw consent. Your right to access your data.
            You have the right to ask us to confirm whether or not we process
            your personal data and, to have access to the personal data, and
            any additional information. That additional information includes
            the purposes for which we process your data, the categories of
            personal data we hold and the recipients of that personal data.
            You may request a copy of your personal data. The first copy will
            be provided free of charge, but we may charge a reasonable fee for
            additional copies. Your right to rectification. If we hold any
            inaccurate personal data about you, you have the right to have
            these inaccuracies rectified. Where necessary for the purposes of
            the processing, you also have the right to have any incomplete
            personal data about you completed. Your right to erasure. In
            certain circumstances you have the right to have personal data
            that we hold about you erased. This will be done without undue
            delay. These circumstances include the following: it is no longer
            necessary for us to hold those personal data in relation to the
            purposes for which they were originally collected or otherwise
            processed; you withdraw your consent to any processing which
            requires consent; the processing is for direct marketing purposes;
            and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However,
            there are certain general exclusions of the right to erasure,
            including where processing is necessary: for exercising the right
            of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a
            legal obligation; or for establishing, exercising or defending
            legal claims. Your right to restrict processing. In certain
            circumstances you have the right for the processing of your
            personal data to be restricted. This is the case where: you do not
            think that the personal data we hold about you is accurate; your
            data is being processed unlawfully, but you do not want your data
            to be erased; it is no longer necessary for us to hold your
            personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you still
            require that personal data in relation to a legal claim; and you
            have objected to processing, and are waiting for that objection to
            be verified. Where processing has been restricted for one of these
            reasons, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we
            will only process it for other reasons: with your consent; in
            relation to a legal claim; for the protection of the rights of
            another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important
            public interest. Your right to object to processing. You can
            object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to
            your particular situation, but only as far as our legal basis for
            the processing is that it is necessary for: the performance of a
            task carried out in the public interest, or in the exercise of any
            official authority vested in us; or the purposes of our legitimate
            interests or those of a third party. If you make an objection, we
            will stop processing your personal information unless we are able
            to: demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing,
            and that these legitimate grounds override your interests, rights
            and freedoms; or the processing is in relation to a legal claim.
            Your right to object to direct marketing. You can object to us
            processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If
            you make an objection, we will stop processing your personal data
            for this purpose. Automated data processing. To the extent that
            the legal basis we are relying on for processing your personal
            data is consent, and where the processing is automated, you are
            entitled to receive your personal data from us in a structured,
            commonly used and machine-readable format. However, you may not
            have this right if it would adversely affect the rights and
            freedoms of others. Complaining to a supervisory authority. If you
            think that our processing of your personal data infringes data
            protection laws, you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory
            authority responsible for data protection. You may do this in the
            EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or
            the place of the alleged infringement. Right to withdraw consent.
            To the extent that the legal basis we are relying on for
            processing your personal data is consent, you are entitled to
            withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the
            lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. Exercising your
            rights. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your
            personal data by written notice to us in addition to the other
            methods specified above.<br />
